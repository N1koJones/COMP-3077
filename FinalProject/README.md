## The purpose of this README.md
The purpose of this is to answer any questions and state certain reasoning regarding marking points made on grading rubric.

# Requirements
### 1. Identify a business case of your choice to describe the catalogue that you want to develop. (e.g. books, cars, blinds, etc..)
### 0.5pts
A description (at least a paragraph) describing what this project is about. Can be placed in the "About" menu.

*My reasoning:* Even though this is put in the About menu, I am putting it here because I want to keep the page immersive. The business case of this choice is to specificly target manga and the exporation and reviewing of them online. This is a space to look at manga volumes and review them with fellow manga fans.

### 2. Identify no less than 20 products, and each product may have at least 2 (or more) different options. (e.g. book cover type, car engine type, blind materials, etc...)
### 1pt
20 products included with minimum 2 options for each.

*My reasoning:* I have over 40 different books total. Each series chosen has at least 3 different volumes available, thus covering this requirement fully.

### 3. There needs to be a common template for the site that can be dynamically changed. Have at least 3 different templates for the site: e.g. three different desktop themes (different look, e.g. Thanksgiving Theme or Christmas Theme, or Regular Theme that automatically changes each season). 
### 3pts (+ 1pt)
3 site wide CSS template (ability to change the template)

*My reasoning:* I have a light theme and a dark theme, as well the ability to toggle between the two with the two inside the header of every page. It follows through in between pages visited. 
I also have a high-visibility mode that removes all colours and the possibility to misread colours. The toggle at the top cycles between the three themes when pressed. You can see the code for this in main.js

### 4. There needs to be dynamic HTML Forms on at least two pages. Example:  A form where you can calculate a quote for the car based on options selected.
### 2 pts
HTML forms x 2

*My reasoning:*
- Form 1
  - I have a recommendations tab that allows you to reccommend series and series volumes to add to the database
- Form 2
  - I have a sign-up and user system that requires you to log in before reccommending a series.

### 5.PHP code and MySQL database well documented
### 5 pts
PHP documented files and MySQL database design included (see 7 below)

*My reasoning:* The code is commented. A lot of it is self explanatory and it is commented accordingly based on explaining the function of certain things.

### 6. All code must be properly commented. 
### 2pts
Proper code documents (comments) throughout all HTML/CSS and JS code files

*My reasoning:* I use basically all *.php* files to create the pages. The HTML/CSS/JS files are all commented where needed and on what their purpose is.

### 7. The project must have a help wiki page(s) to explain to the users how it works (at least 5 different pages). The context sensitive Help link to the corresponding page from the website should be available.
### 2.5 pts
5 Wiki pages (0.5 pt each)

*My reasoning:* 

### 9. The site must have a menu, and responsive (i.e. different screen sizes).
### 1 pt
One main menu

*My reasoning:* The main menu is the same across all pages and can be accessed the same way no matter the page you are on. This flexes to the screen you are on and ***adapts to mobile to be a dropdown menu. ADD THIS***

### 10. There needs to be at least 20 html pages and at least 1 external CSS, and 1 external JS file. Also, at least 20 images (copyright free) and at least 3 video or audio files. It is very important to make the site easy to modify (i.e. add/remove products in the catalogue so users can see fresh items). You can use JavaScript/JSON/CSS combinations for these but make sure it is clear and simple enough for a non-programmer to be able to update the site with basic instructions. (provide instructions in your help wiki page). 
### 4.5 pts

~20 Dynamic pages (1 pt)
*My reasoning:* I have ***15 CHANGE THIS UPDATE THIS*** *.php* pages total that cover all access types including accessing books, reading reviews, sign-ups, and account management

1 CSS file (0.5 pts)
*My reasoning:* I have 1 *.css* file that contains all of the formatting and appropriate comments where needed on the explanation of use.
This file is located at the following path:
> FinalProject/assets/css/main.css

1 JS file (0.5 pts)
*My reasoning:* I have 1 *.js* file that contains all scripts that are required for special functions. The functions are commented appropriately for their purpose and explaining needed code.
This file is located at the following path:
> FinalProject/assets/js/main.js
