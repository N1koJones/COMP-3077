        <h2>Overview of the Navigation Bar</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>nav.php</strong> file is a dynamic navigation bar included at the top of every page. 
            It provides users with quick access to key sections of the website, such as the homepage, books, 
            recommendations, and account-related features.
        </p>
        <p>
            The navigation bar is designed to adapt based on the user's login status and role 
            (e.g., regular user or admin).
        </p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>The <strong>nav.php</strong> file works as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <!-- Step 1: Start a session to check the user's login status and role -->
                The file starts a session to check the user's login status and role.
            </li>
            <li>
                <!-- Step 2: Dynamically generate menu items based on the user's login state -->
                It dynamically generates menu items based on the user's login state:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <!-- If the user is not logged in -->
                        If the user is not logged in, the menu displays options to log in or register.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <!-- If the user is logged in -->
                        If the user is logged in, the menu displays options such as <strong>Profile</strong> 
                        and <strong>Logout</strong>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <!-- If the user is an admin -->
                        If the user is an admin, additional options like <strong>Admin Tools</strong> 
                        and <strong>Admin Guide</strong> are displayed.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <!-- Step 3: Ensure the navigation bar is responsive -->
                The navigation bar is styled to be responsive, ensuring it works well on both desktop 
                and mobile devices.
            </li>
        </ol>
