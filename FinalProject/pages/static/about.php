    <h2>About my WebStore</h2>
    <p>
        I created this WebStore for my favourite professor Dr. Kobti and my love for manga. (IN THAT ORDER!)
        <br><br>
        I wanted to create a platform where I can share my passion for manga with others and provide a space for fellow enthusiasts to discover new series and connect with like-minded individuals. I highly encourage people to leave me with their requests to add to the store, and share their reviews of the manga volumes available.
