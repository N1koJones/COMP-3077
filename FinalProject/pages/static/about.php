    <h2>About my WebStore</h2>
    <p>
        <!-- Introduction about the purpose of the WebStore -->
        I created this WebStore for my favourite professor Dr. Kobti and my love for manga. (IN THAT ORDER!)
        <br><br>
        <!-- Explanation of the platform's goals and features -->
        I wanted to create a platform where I can share my passion for manga with others and provide a space 
        for fellow enthusiasts to discover new series and connect with like-minded individuals. 
        I highly encourage people to leave me with their requests to add to the store, and share their reviews 
        of the manga volumes available.
